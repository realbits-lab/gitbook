Welcome to REALBITS.

**The company has built and is offering services that utilize AI-generative technology.**

With AI-generative technology, users can create content quickly and easily. Writing a blog or product article, as well as other work with private information, requires considerable time and effort. SOTA AI technology enables these types of tasks to be completed quickly and well.

The current chatGPT system cannot follow up on recent information or private information. Therefore, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or TAG (Tool-Augmented Generation) technology has been developed to compensate for this weakness of chatbot LLM technology. After the query has been merged with the data, it is sent to LLM for processing. Using this method, LLM can refer to useful information.

Realbits develops and provides <mark style="color:blue;">**Thothy SaaS**</mark> with SOTA technology, such as performance-optimized LLM and embedding solutions. Additionally, Thothy manages prompts, data, and tools within a bot. The bot can be customized according to user preferences.

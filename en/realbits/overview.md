## AI service

Our company provides a data-driven chatbot SaaS. Your private documents or other public data can be used to ask and receive answers. You can use a chatbot with your own document in confidential mode, or provide a service with your own chatbot API. If you want to use on-premise, we can support with private vector store, embedding, and LLM technology.

{% endhint %}

The data-driven chatbot is similar to QA chatbots that acquire data from documents or databases. User can write a blog posts with product information or make a customer response email with customer history data. If you can manage prompts, you can make a chatbot character like a foreign language teacher or astrologer.

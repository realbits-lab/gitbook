# ðŸ¤˜ Design

## Encourage those who contribute

* Rewarding those who contribute benefits the network's growth and aligns incentives with users.
* It's crucial to note that rewarding contributors is a vital aspect of successful tokenomics, as it links the contributors' success with that of the users and the protocol.

## Enhance the product

* A crucial difference between good and bad tokenomics lies in how the token enhances the product. If the token doesn't significantly improve the product beyond fundraising, it's a sign of poor design.
* Ethereum's tokenomics improve its core distributed computing capability, enabling secure processing of economic contracts that wouldn't be feasible otherwise.
* Maker DAO and Curve benefit from their tokens by fostering community engagement and aligning incentives, thereby enhancing their respective products.
* In each case, the presence of tokens enhances the product. While the product could exist without the token, it becomes stronger because of its inclusion.

## Advantage for holders

* Tokens should benefit holders instead of solely extracting value from them, avoiding a "ponzinomics" approach. These benefits can include utility or social advantages, not just monetary gains.
* Various protocols utilize strategies such as staking, locking, slashing, and escrowing to reduce the velocity of money, although a slower velocity might not always be advantageous.
* Explicitly incorporating a mechanism that directly benefits token holders should be an integral part of the design process.

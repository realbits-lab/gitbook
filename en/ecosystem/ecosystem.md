### Supply Policy Description

* Total token supply
  * 1 billion
* Total Vesting proportion
  * <mark style="color:red;">**Content team**</mark> (20%)
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">**Technology team**</mark> (20%)
  * <mark style="color:green;">**Contributors**</mark> (60%)
* Vesting Frequency
  * 50 release intervals occurring every 5 weeks.
  * Total vesting duration is 250 weeks, equivalent to roughly 5 years.

For each release interval, a specific percentage of tokens is allocated: <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**0.4% for both the content and technology teams (2 million tokens to each)**</mark> and <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**1.2% for the community (12 million tokens)**</mark>.

These tokens are gradually transferred to the respective team accounts or the rent market contract, ensuring a steady and controlled distribution of tokens over the 5-year period.

The aim of this measured approach is to support the long-term commitment and engagement of the content and technology teams while fostering a strong and sustainable community ecosystem.

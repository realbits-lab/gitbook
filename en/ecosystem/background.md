# ‚è∫ Background

## Influencing User Actions

* Bitcoin lacks direct means to force miners to increase hash power. Instead, it incentivizes them with block rewards and transaction fees, crucial for network robustness and security.
* Curve doesn't mandate liquidity contribution, but entices users with CRV token rewards, effectively fostering a vibrant decentralized exchange ecosystem.
* Crafting well-calibrated incentives is a multifaceted task, often requiring a systematic approach encompassing quantitative modeling and stochastic simulations.
* For blockchain developers, the intricacies of tokenomics are crucial, serving as a fundamental toolkit for shaping and guiding user actions.
* Their significance lies not only in driving desired user behaviors but equally in deterring unwanted actions.

## Initiating Synergistic Network Growth

* The bootstrapping problem is a challenge for all marketplace businesses, particularly for new products trying to compete with established industry giants.
* Blockchain products also face this issue, given their n-sided marketplace business model, with network effects becoming crucial for sustained profitability.
* Launching a decentralized product without a token can make it challenging to overcome the bootstrapping effect, while effective tokenomics can significantly enhance network effects, boosting long-term success and resilience against competitors.

## Facilitating User Ownership

* Traditional tech products often begin by offering free services to users, later monetizing these services for the benefit of private shareholders, although this approach has its drawbacks.
* Tokens, as a new form of digital ownership, facilitate community-owned networks and organizations, ensuring that users and contributors, rather than private shareholders, reap the benefits of a product's monetization.
* Blockchain products tend to adopt more cooperative business models with their communities compared to traditional privately owned businesses.
* Unlike in traditional companies where users, owners, and executives are separate entities, blockchain allows users to own, govern, and contribute to products and organizations in unprecedented ways.
* While decentralized governance poses its own challenges, token-based ownership is a fundamental requirement for genuinely decentralized applications such as network states, DAOs, and user-owned protocols.

## Understanding Tokenomics and Product Development

* Tokenomics refers to the specific rules and parameters designed to encourage a community to reach a consensus and add new transactions to the ledger.
* Tokenomics includes both monetary and governance rules that guide user behavior toward a shared objective, even when individual goals might differ.
* It's essential for builders to prioritize solving a problem or creating a solid product before focusing on the token and its mechanics. Many make the mistake of assuming a token alone can solve all issues, designing their product around the token launch rather than the other way around.Understanding Tokenomics and Product Development

# ðŸ“— Thothy

## Architecture

There are two components to Thothy SaaS: the front-end web application and the back-end server. In addition to supporting desktop and mobile web, the web front-end supports Chrome, Safari, and Edge browsers. The back-end server consists of a web server, a vector store, and a LLM framework. There are two types of LLM: OpenAI API and private LLM.

## Components

The Thothy is composed of five components.

### Bot

Bot has model, data, prompt, and tool inside as a link. User can select them from a list view. For example, the user can use a private LLM model, private data, a specific prompt, and an image generation tool. Model is mandatory but data, prompt, and tool are optional. As for chatbots, they can be foreign language teachers or marketing copywriters.

### Model

The model is LLM (Large Language Model). The public LLM is OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. But there are good LLMs available for open commercial license. Realbits is trying to use them as a performance-fine-tuned model. And for the retrieval process, Realbits' fine-tuned embedding model is used. User can choose between a GPT and open LLM.

### Data

Data is retrieved from a vector database. Once user uploads data files to server, server extracts embedding vectors from them, and store in vector database. In case of a query from the user, the server searches for similarity in the vector database. Various file types can be supported.

### Prompt

There are two types of prompts for chatbots. One is system type and the other is user type. As a general rule, the system prompt can manage the entire chat. User can modify chatbot's profile and response behavior using this system prompt. User prompt is a chat prompt. User can query using the prompt provided by this user.

### Tool

Tool is used to perform any task with other systems. A chatbot can search any web page using the web search API, for example, if the user queries for searching a web page using that function. Or with image generation API, user can ask for drawing an image to LLM.
